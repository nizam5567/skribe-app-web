### End-to-end Tests

This project uses Cypress for end-to-end (a.k.a. browser) testing.

Run `yarn cy:run` to execute the tests in the command line. This is useful for verifying code changes because it runs faster than opening a browser window.

Run `yarn cy:open` to open cypress in an interactive window. This is useful for writing and debugging tests. It is slower, but you can see each step of a test as it executes.

Go to the [Cypress Documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/end-to-end-testing/writing-your-first-end-to-end-test) for more information about how to write, run, and debug end-to-end tests using this framework.
